ChatGPT_Latex is a lightweight Manifest V3 extension that detects LaTeX formulas on supported AI chat pages. Hover a recognized formula to copy normalized LaTeX or copy the complete equation to Microsoft Word. Double-click a formula to inspect and edit its source before copying.

## Features

- Detects KaTeX, MathJax, native MathML, and `data-math` formulas.
- Shows one shared hover toolbar with equal-priority **Copy LaTeX** and **Copy to Word** actions.
- Removes physical line breaks, indentation, comments, zero-width characters, and outer math delimiters without removing LaTeX row separators such as `\\`.
- Copies a complete equation to Word as MathML-rich clipboard data, with normalized Word-linear LaTeX as the plain-text fallback.
- Converts common matrix and alignment environments for Word's LaTeX fallback syntax.
- Supports light and dark pages without changing the host formula's layout.
- Runs MathML rendering in the extension service worker rather than loading KaTeX into every page.
- Includes English and Simplified Chinese interfaces.

## Supported pages

- ChatGPT: `chatgpt.com` and `chat.openai.com`
- Claude: `claude.ai`
- DeepSeek: `chat.deepseek.com`
- Gemini: `gemini.google.com`
- Microsoft Copilot: `copilot.microsoft.com`

The extension reads only formula-related DOM on these explicitly matched sites. Page changes by a provider can require a compatibility update.

## Install

### GitHub release

1. Download `ChatGPT_Latex-v1.0.0.zip` from the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/Vinken-y/ChatGPT_Latex/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the extracted `ChatGPT_Latex-v1.0.0` directory.

### Source checkout

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Vinken-y/ChatGPT_Latex.git
```

Load the cloned directory as an unpacked extension. No build step is required.

## Use

1. Open a supported AI chat page containing a rendered formula.
2. Move the pointer over the formula.
3. Choose **Copy LaTeX** or **Copy to Word**. Both actions have equal visual priority.
4. Double-click the formula when you need to review or edit the normalized source.

### What Copy to Word does

**Copy to Word** copies the entire equation, not only its displayed characters. The primary clipboard format is MathML inside `text/html`; supported desktop versions of Word can consume this rich format and create a professional equation when pasted into the document body. Normalized Word-linear LaTeX is included as `text/plain` fallback data.

If a Word configuration ignores the rich clipboard format, press `Alt` + `=` to insert an equation, ensure the equation input mode is LaTeX, paste, and choose **Professional** conversion. That manual sequence is a fallback, not the intended one-click path.

## Compatibility

- Browser target: current Chrome and Microsoft Edge releases on Windows 10/11.
- Word target: current Microsoft 365/Word desktop for Windows.
- Word Online, Word for macOS, LibreOffice, Firefox, and Safari are not currently validated.
- Clipboard policies, protected pages, remote desktop software, or enterprise settings can block rich clipboard writes.

Word supports a subset of LaTeX rather than a complete TeX engine. The editor reports unsupported keywords and environments. MathML is generated with bundled KaTeX under explicit expansion, input-length, and size limits.

## Permissions and privacy

| Permission/scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `clipboardWrite` | Writes only after the user clicks a copy action. |
| `storage` | Stores the close-after-copy preference locally; formulas are never stored. |
| Supported-site content scripts | Detects formula DOM and displays the editor/toolbar. |

Chat content and formulas are not sent to a server, logged, analyzed, or used for telemetry. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the complete disclosure.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 20 or newer.

```powershell
npm ci
npm run validate
npm run check
npm test
```

The shipped extension is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unit tests cover newline normalization, Word fallback conversion, MathML generation, clipboard HTML, dependency limits, and spacing behavior. Local Chrome smoke tests cover formula recognition and the shared toolbar.

## Performance design

- A single `MutationObserver` watches added nodes only; scans are deferred to idle time and processed in bounded chunks.
- One floating toolbar and two click listeners are reused across all formulas.
- Recognition styling uses outline/overlay effects and does not add formula margin or padding.
- KaTeX runs on demand in the extension service worker and is absent from the page content-script bundle.
- Input compatibility checks are debounced while editing.
